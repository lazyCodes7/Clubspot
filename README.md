<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Let's think about schools. Almost all schools have student clubs but due to CoVID-19 these clubs have been disrupted. What if there was a way to provide a platform for students to join clubs and for club-admins to monitor attendance, their club-feedback online. These are the problems that Clubspot was built to solve.

### Built With
